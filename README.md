Once you’ve confirmed that Python is correctly installed, you can proceed with installing Pip.
* Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) to a folder on your computer. Open the link and Right-Click | Save As.
* Open a command prompt. (Windows+R and write cmd.)
* Navigate to the folder containing get-pip.py.

* Run the following command:
```
python get-pip.py
```
You can verify that pip was installed correctly by opening a command prompt and entering the following command:

**Selenium Installing**

* Open your cmd and install Selenium. 
```sh
$ pip install selenium
```

* Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Download one of them. 
 >  [Click for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
 
 >  [Click for FireFox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
 
 >  [Click for Safari](https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10)

* Extract the downloaded driver onto a folder.
* Keep your driver path. You'll need this.
* You are done.

**PyCharm Installing**

* Download [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from this link.

* Run the PyCharm.exe file you've downloaded.
* Follow the instructions in the installation wizard.

## Creating a PyCharm Project

* Open PyCharm.
* Click Create New Project on the Welcome Screen.

* Or on the main menu click File | New Project | Pure Python | Choose your project location.
* Click Create.

## Selenium Methods

When we get the driver object, with these methods that we can perform on a driver. Before we write these methods we have to import webdriver and test our setup(For running instructions go to 'Running the tests'). In PyCharm IDE when we add (.) you will see all the below methods.

```
from selenium import webdriver
    
    driver= webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get('http://google.com')
   
    driver.close()
```


**get ()**
It is used to open specified url browser in windows.
```
...
//to launch the browser
driver.get(http://google.com);
...
```

**page_source()**
It is used to get the source of current load page
```
...
new_source = driver.page_source
print(new_source)
...
```

**close()**
Close the current window, if there are multiple windows, it will close the current window which is active.
```
...
driver.get(“http://www.google.com”);
driver.close();
...
```

**quit()**
It is used to close every associated window which is opened.
```
...
driver.get(“http://www.google.com”);
driver.quit();
...
```

**maximize_window()**
It is used to maximize new window.
```
...
driver.get(“http://www.google.com”);
driver.maximize_window()
...
```

**back()**
This method does the same operation as clicking on the Back Button of any browser.
```
...
driver.back()
...
```

**time()**
It always force the browser to wait for a specific time. We need to import time class. Its not preferred method.
**import time**
```
...
driver.sleep(1000)
...
```
**set_page_load_timeout()**
Its used to set page loading time. 

```
...
driver.set_page_load_timeout(20)
...
```
**implicitly_wait()**
It is used to wait certain time before processing next following code.
```
...
driver.implicitly_wait(20)
...
```
**get_screenshot_as_file()**

Its used to get a screenshot of current page and save this as a specified file(png,jpeg..).
```
...
driver.get_screenshot_as_file("app3.png")
...
```

**switch_the_window()**
This is used to switching 2 open windows. Sometimes you open new window and you still in previous window. You need to switch between 2 windows.

```
...
driver.switch_to.window(driver.window_handles[-1])
driver.switch_to.window(driver.window_handles[0])
...
```

**find_element_by..()**
It is used to find the first element using the given method.

* **find_element_by_id**

This is the most efficient and preferred method to locate an element. Id's are generally unique values.

```
...
driver.find_element_by_id("reset")
...
```

* **find_element_by_name**

Use this when you know name attribute of an element. 

![ ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22459679/53169863-7fda9c80-35ef-11e9-973a-ef14349cf709.PNG)

```
...
element=driver.find_element_by_name("fmt")
...
```

* **find_element_by_class_name**

This is used by locating element by their class name.

![ ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22459679/53170625-a13c8800-35f1-11e9-85b9-b9a03f3abb64.PNG)

```
...
driver.find_element_by_class_name("favorite styled")
...
```

* **find_element_by_xpath**

This is most popular and easiest way to locate elements. This is used to find element by their specific path in case of duplicate or not suitable id's and names.

To find the xpath of html code; right click on the element, click copy and choose "Copy XPath".

![ ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22459679/53171414-af8ba380-35f3-11e9-9025-9d3702e93a63.PNG)

These are different usage of find_element_by_xpath;

```
...
driver.find_element_by_xpath('//input[@placeholder="Must be unique"]')
...
```
```
...
driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="user-edit-page"]/form/div[6]/div/div/input')
...
```

**find_elements_by..()**

It is used to find all elements within the current page


## Selenium Operations and Elements

**click()**

This is used to click on web elements like link, button, radio button, checkbox, images.

```
...
driver.find_element_by_id("submitBtn").click()
...
```

**send_keys()**

This is used to sending inputs into text fields and text areas.

```
...
driver.find_element_by_xpath('//input[@placeholder="Enter role name or code"]').send_keys("test")
...
```

* You need to **import from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys** to use keyboard keys(ENTER,CTRL..) as a key.

```
...
driver.find_element_by_xpath('//input[@placeholder="Enter role name or code"]').send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
...
```


## Running the tests from Cmd

* Open command prompt.
* Go to your project folder. 
``` 
...
cd C:\Users\your\project\location
...
``` 
* Run your test.py class.
``` 
...
python test.py
...
``` 
* Browser will open automatically and will close itself.

## Running the tests from PyCharm

* Use Ctrl + Shift + F10 shortcut.

* Or right click somewhere on your editor body and Click Run 'testAutomation.py'
* Or click green run button on main menu.
